The supermarkets where the ingredients are available will be displayed and based on the user’s location, the nearest supermarkets where the users can buy these ingredients will be displayed. The price of ingredients in each supermarket will be available for the user and the total cost for each recipe will be calculated and displayed so that the user can compare the options available and chose.
